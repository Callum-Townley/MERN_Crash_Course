Product Store
This project is a full-stack product store application I built as part of the FreeCodeCamp MERN stack crash course. 
It demonstrates the integration of the MERN stack with additional tools and frameworks to create a functional and scalable application.

Features
Frontend: Developed with React, Chakra UI for styling, and TypeScript for type safety.
Backend: Built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose for data modeling.
API Testing: Endpoints tested using Postman.
Bundling: used Vite for fast development and production builds.
Deployment: Fully deployed for production use using render.com
